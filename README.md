👉🏻What’s Happening?
✅ Blocks are linked together using hashes.
✅ New transactions are added as blocks.
✅ Tampering with a block invalidates the chain!

👉🏻Conclusion Of Tampering
✅Before tampering → The blockchain is valid (True).
✅After tampering → The blockchain detects the change and marks it as invalid (False).

✔⚡︎✔︎This proves why blockchain is secure—because tampering changes the hashes, and the system can detect it.
